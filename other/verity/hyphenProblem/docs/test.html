<h1>Hyphenation Problem</h1>		
<p>
We are using verity to create and search collections.
The text in the collections includes words with a hyphen (patient-centered) but when searching on patient-centered we don't find any results.
</p>
<p>
Is there a way to search on words with hyphens?
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the help.
