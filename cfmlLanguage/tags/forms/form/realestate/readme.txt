Note: 
-Part 1 of tutorial has the same file and folder names, so they will get overwritten with these. 
If you changed anything there that you'd wish to keep, please make a copy of them, rename the folder or rename this new folder. If you rename the folder, will have to change the component path in Application.cfc.
-If you wish to change data source name or component path, open Application.cfc and change settings there.
-This application will only run on ColdFusion MX 7.01 (ColdFusion MX 7 Updater 1)
